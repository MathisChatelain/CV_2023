            <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>

            <p><strong>Lead Developer, </strong>April 2024 to Present</p>
            <p><strong>Skylls.io</strong> - Lyon, France</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I led a team of four developers in creating a custom web application that allowed users to manage contracts, 
                billing, and recruitment processes, centralizing all of their contractors and subcontractors in one platform.
            </p>
            <br>  
            
            <ul>
                <li>Implemented <strong>Agile methodologies</strong>, managed the project backlog, and coordinated sprints to ensure timely delivery.</li>
                <li>Inspired by open-source, I planned the project's technical roadmap and managed bug tracking using <strong>GitHub Issues</strong>.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Designed the architecture of the project around server side rendering with <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Django</strong> on top of <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>.</li>
                <li>Used <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>HTMX</strong> for a complete yet lightweight and easily debuggable frontend.</li>
                <li>Helped our designer setup and manage a design system based on <strong>DaisyUI</strong> ( CSS + Tailwind ).</li>
                <br>
                <li>Structured and managed the hosting of the project on <strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong> for efficient use of existing GCP resources</li>
                <li>
                    Extensively used internal cloud APIs such as <strong>Google Meet</strong> and 
                    <strong>Google Calendar</strong> for automating recruitment processes, and <strong>Google OAuth</strong> for user authentication, among others.
                </li>
                <br>

                <li>Structured multiple environments for staging, PR preview, and stress testing at a low cost by fully leveraging <strong>Docker</strong>.</li>
                <li>Implemented <strong>CI/CD</strong> pipelines using <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> for automated testing, linting, and deployment.</li>
                <br>

                <li>
                    I had the chance to lead and mentor an apprentice and an intern in their development as junior developers 
                    through <strong>pair programming</strong>, <strong>code reviews</strong> and discussions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensured they felt comfortable and confident in their work, and in the workplace, 
                    I also encouraged them to take on more responsibilities as they progressed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            

            <p><strong>Fullstack Developer, </strong>April, 2022 to December 2023</p>
            <p><strong>SOCOTEC</strong> - Lyon, France</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                During my two years of apprenticeship at SOCOTEC, I primarily worked on a project called AMOS, 
                an internal web application used by the company's engineers and external clients to classify and 
                manage buildings and their components. This pivotal project marked the beginning of a series of 
                applications designed to build on the company's legacy successes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This project taught me nearly everything I knew about web development at that point and gave me the 
                opportunity to work with a team of experienced developers who helped me grow and learn, 
                preparing me to take on management responsibilities in my next role.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The project was built using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Django</strong> on the backend, 
                and <strong>Javascript + Vue.js</strong> on the frontend.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                We relied heavily on our existing <strong>microservices</strong> architecture to build new features, 
                as well as on our open-source project;<br> <strong>django-socio-grpc</strong>,
                a toolkit for building gRPC services inspired by the Django REST framework.
            </p>
